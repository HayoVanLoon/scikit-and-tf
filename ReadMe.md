# Simple ML Models with Scikit and Tensorflow

This repository illustrates the parallel usage of Scikit-learn and Tensorflow
for creating machine learning models for two simple problems.

One is a simple linear regression on a dataset with data points following ```
y = ax + b + E```. The other is a classification on the Iris data set.

Note that this is not an exercise in deciding which framework is better. The 
aim is to show the similarities in the model creation process.
